------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More refactoring. Should be possible to support .pcaps generated from mulitple client versions.
Refactoring and cleanup about as done as I can be bothered to before releasing the source :)

Merchant items that have a quantity other than -1 (mostly player sold items) are included in the SQL, but commented out.

==06/10/2010==

More refactoring.

==06/08/2010==

More refactoring.
Began to move code that may change with EQClient patch versions out into a separate class to allow easier handling of new patches.

==06/07/2010==

Changed GenerateSpawnsSQL to use BitConverter instead of memory streams;
Refactored some code.

Initial implementation of ByteStream class.

==06/06/2010==

For doors of opentype 57 and 58 (ports), the destination zone and coordinates are populated in the doors table, if a matching
zone point exists with the door param of that door. Doortype 57 is also changed to 58 if a matching zp is found.

Processing a capture file which was started while already in a zone and then zoning *should* now process packets for the
second zone correctly.

Released as version 1.9

==06/05/2010==

Reset expected sequence numbers when switching streams.


==06/05/2010==

Permalocked onto stream using C->S OP_ZoneEntry to reduce chance of multi-boxing messing the collect up.
Version clause is appended to query when updating existing npc_types.
Selecting the update existing npc types option will automatically uncheck all other options.
Reworked texture/helm parsing, so hopefully NPCs should look as close as possible to live now (as close as we can without having textures for each armor slot in npc_types).
Added 'experimental option to add texture colors to npc_types_tint so that different armor slots can have different colors.

Released as version 1.8

-------------------------------

==06/04/2010==

Fixed bug introduced in v1.6 that broke merchant SQL generation.
Gender is now updated for existing npc_types.
Guard races are now included when updating existing npc_types.
Obtained the ZoneID number from the Player Profile instead of the NewZone_Struct.

Released as version 1.7

-------------------------------

==06/03/2010==

The zone long name should no longer be truncated at 32 characters.
Apostrophes in the zone long name are escaped, i.e. Dranik's Hollows should be Dranik\'s Hollows.
The 'Update Existing NPC Types' option is now available. If selected, the following columns:

  texture, helmtexture, size, face, luclin_hairstyle, luclin_haircolor, luclin_eyecolor, luclin_eyecolor2, luclin_beardcolor,
  luclin_beard, drakkin_heritage, drakkin_tattoo, drakkin_details, armortint_red, armortint_green, armortint_blue,
  d_meele_texture1, d_meele_texture2, findable

  will be updated for existing rows in the npc_types table that meet the following criteria:

    Their ID falls within the range specified.
	The NPC is a playable race (Race <= 12 || Race == 128 || Race == 130 || Race == 330 || Race == 522)
	The NPC name is unique in the sense that only one NPC with the given first name was seen in the packet collect.

Released as version 1.6


==06/02/2010==

Implemented in 1.5 but not mentioned in changelog: Player mounts no longer included in SQL.

----------------------

==06/02/2010==

Fixed bug which caused the first spawn to always be skipped.
Update generated for fog_density column in zone table.
Populated Drakkin specific fields in npc_types.
Did some work on updating existing npc_types but left it disabled until an issue is resolved.

Released as version 1.5

==06/01/2010==

Changed doors and object/ground spawn extractors to use Bitconverter instead of memory streams.

==05/31/2010==

If zone config and/or zone points are selected, the generated SQL will no longer be commented out.
---------------------------------

==05/31/2010==
Populated Melee texture columns.
For playable races, equip_chest2 is set based on the equipped chest item, if one is equipped.
Set armour tint columns based on the colour field for the chest slot.

The starting IDs for database inserts are now set as variables at the top of the SQL:
  Note the Door ID has changed meaning. Instead of being the value for the id column in the doors table,
  it is now the base value for the doorid column. The id column will just use the next autoincrement id.

If the version number is none-zero, The base doorid = Version * 1000 and all other insert IDs are
  set to ZoneID * 1000 + (Version * 100).

If the version number is none-zero, deletes for npc_types and the spawn tables will only be generated from
  the starting InsertID to starting ID + 99.

Moved the Version NumericUpDown control to before the InsertID textboxes as changing the version will
 auto-change the InsertIDs.

Corrected a bug where IT10805 objects were flagged as ovens instead of brew barrels.
Added checkboxes (default unchecked) for zone config (fog, safe point, etc) and zone points.

Released as version 1.1
-------------------------------------------

Added apostrophes around short name in zone UPDATE statement.
Added Dump AA button to dump AA info.
